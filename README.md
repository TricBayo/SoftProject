â€¨A Newspaper Delivery System
 
This system is intended to manage the delivery of newspapers and magazines in some small town or area of a larger town. It is intended for use by newsagents who are only casual users of computer systems and should run on a PC or similar hardware. 

Factors taken into account in specifying and designing this system are:
1 - For each delivery person, the system must print, each day, the publications to be delivered to each address.
2 - The system should also print, for the newsagent, a summary of who received what publications each day.
3 - Whether the newspapers and magazines are in stock.

Once a month, bills are delivered to customers along with their newspapers. These bills should be computed automatically by the system.
Customers come and go and may be away temporarily on holiday or on business.

Not all customers necessarily have a delivery every day.

The system should be able to manage some simple geographic information so that it prints information for the delivery person in the order in which publications are delivered.
